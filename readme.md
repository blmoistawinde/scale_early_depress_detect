The 3 folders contains the code for each dataset. Detailed information an be seen in the `readme` inside the directories. 

The main experiments are conducted on `erisk2017` dataset, while we also test the generalizability of the proposed model on the other 2 datasets (See Appendix).

We can't include the dataset here due to the terms and restrictions of them, but their their information can be found in [eRisk2017](https://erisk.irlab.org/2017/index.html), [RSDD](https://georgetown-ir-lab.github.io/emnlp17-depression/) and [Topic-Restircted](https://aclanthology.org/W18-4102/) (Retrieved with the implementation in https://github.com/kharrigian/emnlp-2020-mental-health-generalization)
